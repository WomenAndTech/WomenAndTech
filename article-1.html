						How does she make all this work together? To find out I met Lucia at the Yonge and Eglinton Starbucks after she put her kids to bed. 8:30pm – when we met for a coffee – is when Lucia begins the second half of her day. She had her second child nine months ago and is currently on maternity leave.

				<span class="span6">
					<span id="right">
						Given the inflexible demands on her time, she must be sure to work efficiently. In our hour-long conversation we discussed where and when her interest in technology began, her mentors, her family, her thoughts on women in the industry and how she stays tuned into her career while raising a family.

				<h3>Tell us a bit about yourself and how you got your start.</h3>
				<p>
					I’ve been in the industry for about 10 years. I completed my Arts Management degree at the University of Toronto. That was where I started in web design. They wanted someone with an artistic background who could learn to code on the fly. At the time, they were trying to get faculty members to publish their dissertations in electronic format so I started designing ebooks and educational websites. I eventually landed at St. George Campus working with the VP of Research doing web design and development to push out the exciting research that was happening at the university.
				</p>
				<p>
					I did my Masters in Information Systems part-time at U of T while I worked. That was an interesting program because it was funneled through the library program so you got to work with people from different disciplines like engineering, architecture, computer science and library science. We built prototypes for various interfaces and you had eight weeks to build something. It had an incubator kind of feel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Around that time, I met my husband in an Intro to HTML class. Up to that point I had been hacking and learning everything on my own so I thought let’s go to college for a bit and learn some of the practical stuff. We now have two children together. When I took my leave at U of T, I jumped into his company, Feast Interactive. He had been doing a lot of web development for different brands and I thought he should really push the social media side of things, so I started doing digital strategy for him. Now I’m taking all of my experience and applying it to this company that we’re growing together.

				<div class="span8 offset3 new-line interview-panel">
				<p>
					After my son was born, I started getting involved with Girls In Tech. It’s hard to jump from being in a good position and working a lot to staying home with the kids. I needed to do something. That first year when you’re at home is a weird transitional time – it is for many women I think. So I started the Girls in Tech group in Toronto.

				<h3>Did Girls in Tech already exist at that time?</h3>
				<p>
					Not in Toronto. One late night I was looking for a group, a network of other women in tech to reach out to. I found this organization in the States: Girls in Tech, but I noticed there wasn’t a local chapter in Toronto. So I reached out to them and told them I’d be interested in starting one. At the same time, my partner Neha was also interested so we connected and decided to get it going. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We were seeing the same people saying the same things in conferences and we wanted to bring different people, different women to the table and give them an opportunity to showcase their work and present their ideas through Girls in Tech. It’s been about a year and we’ve had six events so far. It’s really taken off. We have a good community and it keeps getting better.

				<h3>Do you see the same women coming to Girls in Tech events?</h3>
				<p>
					It varies. There’s always the core group but different people come out depending on the content. For one session we had an academic panel. There’s a high dropout rate of women in STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] and we wanted to ask why this was happening so we brought in some academics who do research in the area. That drew a different crowd. We met women with a tech background who came to Canada looking for jobs and were having trouble finding something. I really didn’t know how to help them. I find it interesting that that’s happening in Toronto. It stuck with me and I haven’t addressed that yet.

				<h3>What thoughts came out of that panel?</h3>
				<p>
					Mary Wells who is at the University of Waterloo – she’s an engineer, a mom and a really impressive woman. Her thesis is that you really have to get to children when they’re young, like grade 4 or 5 to get them interested in the sciences and math. After that, it’s a bit too late. That’s her philosophy.

			<div class="span8 interview-panel">
				<h3>Do you think that the structure of these programs need to change?</h3>
				<p>
					I think women tend to stick to certain fields like health and education because down the road the schedules are more accommodating to the life they want to have. But what I’ve learned so far is that even though I have less time because I’m a mom and I have two kids to take care of, I have chunks of time where I can be efficient and get things done. You have to be very focused. That’s a certain mindset you have to learn. One of two things happens: you either become overwhelmed or you become very efficient.

				<h3>Were you overwhelmed?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes. Everyone has different choices but I breastfed my children. I was up with them at night and especially with the first one, you don’t know what to expect. Lack of sleep and being tired is overwhelming. You feel like you’re unplugged from the world. But I invested in an iPhone and I used it to keep reading. I would read when I was up breastfeeding. That’s when I became very active and more involved. Being connected empowered me and helped me to keep up with the world and the industry.
