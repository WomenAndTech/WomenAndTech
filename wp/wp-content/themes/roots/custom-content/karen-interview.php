        <h3>Is your background more technical- or communications-based?</h3>
        <p>A blend of both actually.</p>
        <p>I always found opportunities to engage with technology wherever I could. I was self taught in voice, data and internet technology, which eventually led me to teaching those subjects at the enterprise level. I was also programming with my gifted classes in grade five, before I even knew that I could actually study computer science as an option. My mom was one of the first women I ever knew who was learning DOS and <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/pictures/dinosaur-sightings-lotus-symphony-30/1/">Symphony</a>. So I guess I got a little bit of that taste from her. I've also always been able to take very dense, seemingly boring electronics and data technology and communicate it so that people could understand its importance.
        People think learning is black and white, that there's one way to write a line of code, for example, and that's the way you do it. There is a way to do it, but there are a whole bunch of creative methods. There is a lot of grey in the world. I love living in the grey, and explaining things through that grey filter.</p>

       <h3>I&#39;m interested in your definition of technological literacy.</h3>
       <p>For me it&#39;s a Renaissance term. I&#39;m a lifetime learner. I love anthropology, I love poetry, I love art, I love how these things all connect. As a kid I loved Da Vinci, and it was not just the Mona Lisa–it was looking at his drawings, his creations and his inventions and thinking, “How could you think that way?”</p>
       <p>I think coding is a good skill to have, I think we should be teaching it early, in elementary and middle school. Absolutely we should be building that kind of functional literacy. But I don&#39;t think for a second that you can separate technology from its impact on society. You can’t separate it from art. I think that for me, literacy is about understanding how technology has impacted the human experience throughout history.</p>

        <p>Social media, for sure. For me Twitter was the platform that absolutely changed my life.</p>
        <p>When I moved out of Toronto thirteen years ago with my family to Stratford, Ontario, I found it hard to connect with people I felt were like me. I started tweeting about local stuff and began to realize I was not just speaking to Stratford, there was a wider network there.

       <p>First of all, listen. Find out what's going on, follow the followers, find something that interests you or someone that you think is pretty cool, or if somebody has a great audience online, look at who's following them and at who they're following.</p>

        <p>There are a couple of things. One is a desire to solve problems. Do you like to take things apart and put them together? I like to knit, which is a form of problem-solving. I figure out how I want something to look, and then I figure out the knitting pattern to make it. Did you like to play with Legos as a kid? Did you like to build things? When I was a kid, our VCR broke and I took it apart. I didn't fix it, or anything—I just wanted to see what was inside.</p>

        <p>And the other, which I think women in particular are socialized against, is being willing to handle rejection without taking it personally. I’ve found this from my own experience, and I've heard it from other women as well: If I applied to Google and got rejected, what are the chances I would apply again?</p>
        <p>There's been a conversation going on around here, about how do we hire more women? Google gets so many resumes that there are false negatives, which means we say no to people who are totally qualified. People who are more easily discouraged by that rejection are going to be less likely to try again in a year or two. There are a few different things to consider when re-applying, one is you might have been a false negative in the first place, and another is, you might have actually gotten better since you first applied. Maybe you weren't quite above the bar last year, but maybe since then you’ve done an amazing project and learned so much, and now you can do it.</p>

        <p>I do think it's important that, as an industry, we make the effort to be more inclusive and to recognize discrimination when it happens.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, for women that are in the industry now, we have to deal with the system as it is today. I'm always very pragmatic. I’m not saying it’s anyone’s fault, but there's a certain amount of the world that we just have to deal with. You can choose to take things personally, take offense at things and be hurt, or you can take a step back and say, “Okay, that sucked. What can I do to do better next time?
