        <h3>Please introduce yourself.</h3>
        <p>My name is Ariel Garten, I’m the CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://interaxon.ca" target="_blank"
          title="InteraXon's website" alt="InteraXon">InteraXon</a>. At InteraXon we create thought controlled computing products, applications and experiences. Thought-controlled computing is exactly what it sounds like &mdash; it’s the ability to interact with content and yourself. A sensor sits on your forehead, reads your brainwaves, and then lets you play games on your smartphone or tablet directed by your brain. It also lets you see your brain and engagement activity to improve your working memory, concentration, circulation etc.</p>

        <h3>Tell us more about your background.</h3>
        <p>My background spans arts, science and business. I was in real estate since I was a kid. My dad sent me to show the apartments. At university, I studied neuroscience and ran a clothing line that I had started in high school. I sold to stores in Toronto, and I had a job in a research lab. So I’ve always been able to move back and forth between art and science, and I find both completely stimulating. When I graduated, I continued to work at the research lab and opened my own clothing store on College Street, expanding to sell my line to small boutiques across North America.</p>

        <p>I was looking for a way to talk about the self and understand the self from scientific and artistic perspectives. I started working with brainwaves in <a href="http://n1nlf-1.eecg.toronto.edu/" title="Steve Mann's Personal Web Page"  target="_blank">Steve Mann’s lab</a> almost a decade ago. Ultimately we created a system that I took out of the lab and started to commercialize with my two co-founders, Trevor Colemen and Chris Aimone. That was the formation of InteraXon, which has existed for the last five years. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJS8EJwGx3o" target="_blank" title="InteraXon Bright Ideas Promotional Video on YouTube">Our first major project</a> was the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.

My mother is not connected to science or technology; she’s extraordinarily intelligent and inquisitive but she processes the world through a brush and through linguistics.

In high school I did great at science and I did okay at math, but I was into abstract concepts. I loved logic &mdash; loved, loved, loved logic, like I loved doing puzzles. When everyone in university hated multiple choice, I loved multiple choice. Just to know the totality of the answers!</p>

        <h3>Why do you think there aren’t more young women choosing to pursue a career in science?</h3>
        <p>There’s definitely a tendency where people can, from a young age, identify, ‘I’m good at this, I’m not good at this, and this is scary.’ And if you decide you aren’t good at something, you don’t take the time to build the skill. You shut down and you don’t engage with it.</p>

        <p>I’m also a psychotherapist. I had a patient recently who said, “Numbers scare me. You say the word finance and I want to jump under the table over there.” And it was a process of moving aside her fear, seeing these things as neutral, allowing herself to open up to numbers so that she could spend time learning without feeling anxiety and insecurity.</p>
        <p>Insecurity is definitely an issue when you are growing up. And when you do something that you don’t know the answer to, your response to not knowing will determine your ability to learn it.</p>

       <div class="span7 offset4 interview-panel">
        <p>If your response to not knowing is, ‘I don’t know it, therefore I feel uncomfortable, therefore I want to run away because it makes me feel insecure,’ then you’re not going to have the confidence, patience, willingness and openness to sit down and say, ‘I don’t know this but I'm not scared, I'm just going to sit here and figure it out.’ Your early responses and experiences will determine whether you go into a subject or not.</p>

        <h3>Why do you think there is an imbalance between the number of men and women working in technology?</h3>
        <p>I'm tempted to think that early on there was a misidentification about who was good at math and who wasn't. And as we break down gender barriers, my guess would be that in classrooms now you see much less differentiation between the number of males and females. There are so many girls who rock at math!</p>
        <p>In my generation, to get into computational neuroscience you had to do computer science first. I think in 15 years, in fields like computational neuroscience where there are equal opportunities to learn computer science, or if it becomes acceptable for girls to sit in their basement and figure out code, we’ll see leveling off of males vs. females.</p>

        <h3>Can you tell us about your role as a female tech entrepreneur?</h3>
        <p>Well, I'm definitely in the vast minority. For example, I was invited to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/28/f50/" title="Alexia Tsotsis' article on the Founders Fund's first attempt at a tech conference published on TechCrunch.com">a tech conference for the 50 brightest minds in technology</a>. They flew us on a private jet to Hawaii, made it a big deal, it was pretty cool. There were 50 people &mdash; only five were women.</p>
        <p>As a rare bird in this full nest, I have to say I don’t mind. I can work being female to my advantage. We joke that if our demo isn’t working at a conference, I can just wear the headset and smile and that would be enough.</p>
        <p>Everyone has their own advantages regardless of gender. I’m in a unique position at this point in time as a woman tech CEO.</p>

      <div class="span7 offset4 interview-panel">
        <h3>How do you think it is advantageous to be a woman in technology?</h3>
        <p>I'm aware that because I am a rare female in the tech executive space, I may receive special treatment. And probably part of my success is due to the fact that I’m female. It’s fetishized, not in a sexual way, but through that fetishization the female role becomes iconic, creating an archetype other people can follow. That leads to role models and creates a path for more women.</p>

        <p>I don't think there should be any natural order, unless not being that way leads to some sort of system of oppression. And I guess a feminist would argue that this kind of inequality is inherently systemic and self-perpetuating oppression. [Pauses] I can buy into that, but it's not naturally how I feel. I've never felt oppressed as a female. I've never felt that I have been withheld opportunity because of my gender.
